<p>A little over 7 months ago I <a href="http://jwhollister.com/r/2015/03/13/quickmapr-pre-release.html">posted</a> about a package that I had been working on, <code>quickmapr</code>. That was the pre-release version, the one that I finished up today and submitted to CRAN is a bit more polished, plots rasters a bit quicker, and is, I think, ready for wider release. It is now availble from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quickmapr/index.html">CRAN</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/jhollist/quickmapr/blob/master/README.md">README on GitHub</a> provides details plus some examples using a small dataset included with the package. I would be thrilled to get some feedback from people on the package, ease of use, suggestions for improvements, etc. I would be even more thrilled if you try it out on different datasets. Any thoughts just add them as <a href="https://github.com/jhollist/quickmapr/issues">issues</a>.</p>
