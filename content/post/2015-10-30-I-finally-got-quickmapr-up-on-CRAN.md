A little over 7 months ago I [posted](http://jwhollister.com/r/2015/03/13/quickmapr-pre-release.html) about a package that I had been working on, `quickmapr`.  That was the pre-release version, the one that I finished up today and submitted to CRAN is a bit more polished, plots rasters a bit quicker, and is, I think, ready for wider release. It is now availble from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quickmapr/index.html).

The [README on GitHub](https://github.com/jhollist/quickmapr/blob/master/README.md) provides details plus some examples using a small dataset included with the package.  I would be thrilled to get some feedback from people on the package, ease of use, suggestions for improvements, etc.  I would be even more thrilled if you try it out on different datasets.  Any thoughts just add them as [issues](https://github.com/jhollist/quickmapr/issues).
