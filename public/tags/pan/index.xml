      <description>A little over 7 months ago I posted about a package that I had been working on, quickmapr. That was the pre-release version, the one that I finished up today and submitted to CRAN is a bit more polished, plots rasters a bit quicker, and is, I think, ready for wider release. It is now availble from CRAN.
The README on GitHub provides details plus some examples using a small dataset included with the package.</description>

      <description>I do a lot of GIS. That used to mean firing up any one of the esri products, but over the course of the last couple of years I have done that less and less and instead fired up R.
When I first started using R for my spatial analysis work I often was left struggling with viewing the results of my analysis and could only do so with a clunky workflow of pushing my sp or raster objects out to shapefiles or tiffs and then pulling those into Arcmap.</description>
